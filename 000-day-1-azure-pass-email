Hey Everyone,

Looking forward to the Azure Deep Dive Class with you!  Yay!

These are the codes (attached) we will be using for class this week.  To use them… this is really important:
 
1 – We are going to be using “disposable accounts” for this training.  

PLEASE DO NOT USE YOUR STARBUCKS ACCOUNTS FOR THESE PASSES.  IT MAY CAUSE YOU PROBLEMS.
 
So first thing is go to http://www.live.com  and create a new junk email account for this week…   
 
2- Then use the code below next to your name, and goto www.microsoftazurepass.com  to redeem the azure pass…  Make sure you actually hit the activate button in the process…
 
3- After we are all done, you should be able to logon to  https://portal.azure.com
 
4- Below is Joe’s and my email and info.  Feel free to use this for class any time…
