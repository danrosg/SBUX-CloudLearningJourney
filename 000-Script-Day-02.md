# Script for Day 2

Okay. How is everybody doing? 

We want to make sure we have set the objectives for this Azure Deep Dive. 
The best way to learn it is to do it. And the best way to learn is at your own pace, in your own learning style. 

We treat these sessions more like a hackathon than a lecture series. We want you to go through the process of identifying what you want to do in Azure, how to explore it and learn about it, what are your tools, etc. And just try doing it and see how far you get. 

We are your coaches - and assistants. 

So instead of preparing everything, we are going to do - hey, how do I want to learn about this.  How would I learn about this.


The balance on this is that we need to make sure everyone has an understanding of key concepts in azure. So when you work with and interact with other teams, your own teams, you know what those common things are. 

Let's make a list. 
NSG's,  Virtual Networks, LB, AGW, Traffic Manager, VM's,  Availability sets,  
Websites, Web Jobs, Azure FX and Logic Apps, Event Hubs, Service Bus, 
Service Principal, AZ AD, Key Vault 
CLI, Powershell, ARM templates. 
VSO, Jenkins, Github, 
Service Fabric, 

Azure portal - learn new product method

Concepts
Server less, VM's, Microservices, 
Auto scale, others? 

Methods of learning:
Azure.Com - Docs.microsoft.com. 
Github.com - videos (docs and YouTube) 
Search - Bing or Google 
Stackoverflow 

Next set of labs are going to be self taught, and we are going to help advise, and learn.

For example, what are things that everyone needs to know about when it comes to using Azure

Resource Groups, NSG's, security center, monitoring, key vault, arm templates, CLI - Powershell, azure active directory, service principals...

Other concepts
Iaas vs paas offerings - serverless
Microservices
Containers


So day two three and four, we are going to shift responsibility for learning and labs to you. 

Instead of lecturing on topics, we are going to as a group pick topics and explore things that everyone needs to 'know'... And in that process, develop a methodology for you doing this on your ownâ€¦  with our assistance.  But it's about empowering you to do this stuff..
