# Prerequisites 
Looking forward to the Azure Deep Dive this week. Best way to learn Azure is hands on, and we are going to do lots of hands on work in Azure this week.
 
Windows, use the Webplatform Installer:
https://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx
- download and run installer
- install Microsoft Azure Powershell latest version

We will also be working with Azure CLI 2.0
 
Mac + Windows 
Azure CLI 2.0

Re: Dev Environment:
Lastest VisualStudio version your organization supports
https://www.visualstudio.com/
 
If not using VisualStudio, that's okay.  Bring your favorite development environment.
 
 
Note: This schedule maybe adjusted to allow us some flexibility in the classroom. We are also looking for a session to discuss Event Hubs, Service Fabric and other subjects that come up in our opening sessions. At the same time, working to avoid lectures and do more hands on labs.
