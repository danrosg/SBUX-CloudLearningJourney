## Workshop Goal: The End Game – Equipping you to build/learn/explore Azure 
 
The End game. Equip you with knowledge and tools on how to go from where are now to building and/or running the Azure solution that you need to run.  And exploring something new. We want you to be ready to do it, and confident that you can find resources where you have gaps.
