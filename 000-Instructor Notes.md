What this workshop is not: 
-	Not a lecture series 
-	Not paint by the numbers 
-	More of a hackathon less of a workshop – trying to make it relevant to what you will be doing in Azure
-	Group learning and Labs

Level Set Background / Quick Review of Fundamentals

Deploying with ARM templates – using PS, CLI, Portal 




Other Notes: 
Let's discuss: Updated Draft below
Need to work in the github topic, (which I think I have in the PaaS section)
Splunk Agent / Storage
Anything about Jenkins + VSTS?  Not sure how much they need to know in class on this... 
Let's discuss

To Portal or to Powershell ?
Discussion on when you think you should do what?



Notes from Evandro Call:

Different Teams: are doing things different

Talk about the stack – IPS 

Service Fabric, Event Hub, Key Vault Integration, CosmosDB

Digital platforms, arm templates, teraform...   (Deployments - (see what it looks like...)  )

Key vault – how we are using it... 
We create the keys during provisioning, upload, all the keys.
For eventhub, do encryption/decripiton that flows through eventhub
Hsm key - 

More of a hackathon, less of a lecture series... 

Event Hub: 
Bitbucket.org - github... () 

What ports to open up for SF cluster... (sr) 

Lunch - 

David Lewis – cicd pipeline teraform, 
Ivan Bondy - 
Rick Adams
